# Forecasting-Website
Problem Statement: Are the forecasting methods taught in the classroom profitable trading strategies?

This repository contains all the code and data that I will be using to predict the next days price of NVIDIA (NVDA). This project will be used as a refresher/learning course for me. I have implemented the models in this repository using R before, but this project will be based in Python, which I have not used for traditional forecasting methods. All of my code will provide in-depth explanations incase someone who is learning forecasting stumbles upon this repository. I will have my code drafts in the repository, which will be updated daily. 

Models to use for forecasting
- Regression based (lags)
- Smoothing models
- AR/ARIMA
- LSTM
- Maybe up down forecast w Logit?
- Random Walk or coin flip comparison
