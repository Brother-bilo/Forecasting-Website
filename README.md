# Forecasting-Website
This repository contains my website that predicts the next days price of NVIDIA using a variety of forecasting methods and tracks the performance of each model. I could see this website eventually being my home for of my dev work. 

I created this project to refresh and improve upon my time series analysis skills. Additionally, this website allows me to improve my web dev skills. 

**I know how to apply all these models with R, but I will be using python only since I am adding more libraries to my repertoire!

Models to use for forecasting
- AR/ARIMA
- Regression based (lags)
- Smoothing models
- LSTM
- Maybe up down forecast w Logit?
- Random Walk or coin flip comparison
